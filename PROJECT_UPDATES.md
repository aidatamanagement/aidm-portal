  - Progress was only counting lessons with user progress records, not total course lessons
  - Now shows accurate completed/total format for enrolled courses

**Root Cause**:
- Dashboard was counting `user_progress` records instead of total lessons in enrolled courses
- Only lessons that students had started were being counted in the total
- Missing proper calculation of all available lessons vs completed lessons

- Added real-time subscriptions for `lessons` and `user_course_assignments` tables
- Enhanced logging for debugging progress calculations

**Before vs After**:

- **After**: Shows "3/5 lessons" (completed out of total available)

**Progress Calculation Logic**:
```typescript
// Get enrolled course IDs
const enrolledCourseIds = coursesResult.data.map(c => c.course_id);

// Fetch ALL lessons for enrolled courses
const { data: allLessons } = await supabase
  .from('lessons')
  .select('id, course_id')
  .in('course_id', enrolledCourseIds);

// Total lessons = all lessons in enrolled courses
const totalLessons = allLessons?.length || 0;

// Completed lessons = progress records marked as completed
const completedLessonIds = progressResult.data?.filter(p => p.completed).map(p => p.lesson_id) || [];

// Only count completed lessons that exist in enrolled courses
const completedLessons = completedLessonIds.filter(lessonId => 
  allLessons?.some(lesson => lesson.id === lessonId)
).length;
```

**Real-time Updates**:
- Added subscriptions for lessons table changes
